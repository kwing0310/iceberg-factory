![example](./example.png)

## Installation
1. Clone the repo.
2. Install the required packages using pip as shown below:
```
pip3 install rich image-go-nord argparse
```
## Usage
Go to the directory containing the `conv.py` script and run it using:
```
python3 conv.py
```

 Then follow the on-screen instructions, and voila you'll have your tokyo-night themed image ready in no time!


## Note
The output image usually doesn't looks good only when the input image is complex or has a lot of colors. It works best with simple minimal images with a few colors like the image shown above. Keep this in mind
